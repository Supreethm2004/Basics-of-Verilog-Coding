A **half adder** is a fundamental digital circuit used to perform the addition of two binary digits. It consists of two inputs and two outputs. The purpose of the half adder is to sum two single-bit binary numbers and produce a sum output and a carry output.

### Components of a Half Adder:
1. **Inputs**: 
   - **A**: First binary digit (bit).
   - **B**: Second binary digit (bit).
   
2. **Outputs**:
   - **Sum (S)**: This is the least significant bit (LSB) of the sum of the two inputs.
   - **Carry (C)**: This is the most significant bit (MSB) that indicates a carry-over if the sum exceeds 1 (binary addition overflow).

### Truth Table for a Half Adder:
The truth table shows the possible inputs and their corresponding outputs.

| A | B | Sum (S) | Carry (C) |
|---|---|---------|-----------|
| 0 | 0 |    0    |     0     |
| 0 | 1 |    1    |     0     |
| 1 | 0 |    1    |     0     |
| 1 | 1 |    0    |     1     |

From the truth table:
- When **A = 0** and **B = 0**, the sum is 0, and no carry is generated.
- When **A = 0** and **B = 1** (or **A = 1** and **B = 0**), the sum is 1, and no carry is generated.
- When **A = 1** and **B = 1**, the sum is 0 (since 1 + 1 = 10 in binary, which means a sum of 0 and a carry of 1).

### Logic Expressions for Half Adder:
1. **Sum (S)**: 
   The sum output is produced by an **XOR** (exclusive OR) gate.
   \[
   S = A \oplus B
   \]
   The XOR gate outputs a 1 if the inputs are different (0, 1 or 1, 0) and outputs a 0 if the inputs are the same (0, 0 or 1, 1).

2. **Carry (C)**:
   The carry output is produced by an **AND** gate.
   \[
   C = A \cdot B
   \]
   The AND gate outputs a 1 only if both inputs are 1.

### Circuit Diagram:
The half adder can be implemented using:
- An **XOR gate** for the sum (S).
- An **AND gate** for the carry (C).

### Application of Half Adder:
- **Binary Addition**: The half adder is used in simple binary addition operations.
- **Building Blocks**: It serves as a building block for more complex arithmetic circuits such as the **full adder**, **binary adders**, and **arithmetic logic units (ALUs)**.

### Limitations of the Half Adder:
- The half adder cannot account for a carry input from a previous stage. It only adds two binary digits without considering a carry input. This is where a **full adder** comes in, which can handle an additional input for a carry.

### Conclusion:
The half adder is one of the simplest and foundational components of digital electronics. It provides the basic functionality for adding two binary numbers and can be expanded into more complex circuits to handle multi-bit binary addition.
